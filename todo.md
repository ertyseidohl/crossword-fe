## Backlog
- Local words can show up again in the server results
- Recover saved data if it's not complete
- Start with 0th square focused
- Arrows for click to change page
- Add mouse support everywhere
- Multiple crosswords at the same time
- Clues may not turn black after changing a letter if you change the letter back

## Long Shots
- Long Solve via token / background job
- Parallelism on the server
- Block word list
