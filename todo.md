# TODO
## MVP
- Clearing messages
- Print and Print Sol'n should be different
- Last page with 1 element (and one matching local word) seems broken

## Backlog
- Local words can show up again in the server results
- Recover saved data if it's not complete
- Start with 0th square focused
- Arrows for click to change page
- Add mouse support everywhere
- Multiple crosswords at the same time
- Need to test corner cases of turning clues red

## Long Shots
- Long Solve via token / background job
- Parallelism on the server
- Block word list
- "solve for n words"
- Use preferred words for solve
